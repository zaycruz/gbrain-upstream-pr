/**
 * v0.32.2 — extract_facts cycle phase.
 *
 * Reconciles the facts DB index from the `## Facts` fence on each
 * entity page. Runs between the `extract` phase (which materializes
 * links + timeline) and `recompute_emotional_weight` so emotional
 * weight sees fresh take + fact state.
 *
 * Source-of-truth contract: the fence is canonical. For each page in
 * the affected slug set, this phase:
 *   1. Reads the markdown body (DB-side fetch via engine.getPage).
 *   2. Parses the `## Facts` fence with parseFactsFence.
 *   3. Maps ParsedFact → FenceExtractedFact via extractFactsFromFenceText.
 *   4. De-dupes rows by canonical (claim, source) content key.
 *   5. Reconciles the page-scoped DB index: no-op when already in sync,
 *      insert only missing keys when possible, or wipe/reinsert when stale
 *      DB rows need cleanup (#1781 — the unconditional wipe-and-reinsert
 *      made every cycle non-idempotent, re-appending duplicate rows).
 *
 * After the phase, the DB index for every cleanly parsed affected page
 * matches the fence's canonical (claim, source) row set (modulo embeddings
 * + runtime-derived fields). Warning-bearing parses are non-authoritative
 * and preserve that page's existing index. Pages with no fence wipe DB rows
 * for that page coordinate only; legacy NULL-source_markdown_slug rows
 * survive because deleteFactsForPage targets source_markdown_slug = slug only.
 *
 * Empty-fence guard (Codex R2-#7; #2484; #2646): the phase refuses to do
 * its destructive reconciliation pass when genuinely-backfillable legacy
 * rows still exist — in THIS run's source only (`source_id = sourceId`;
 * a pending row in source A must not jam extraction for source B — the
 * source-isolation invariant) — `row_num IS NULL` (never fenced) AND
 * `entity_slug` resolves to a live page in this source (so the v0_32_2
 * migration's Phase B could fence them) AND the row is not soft-expired
 * (`expired_at IS NULL`). Status returns `warn` with a hint to re-run
 * the v0.32.2 fence backfill (`apply-migrations --force-retry 0.32.2`
 * then `--yes` — a bare `--yes` is a no-op once the ledger says
 * complete). Without the guard, an interrupted upgrade where v0_32_2
 * hasn't run could leave the cycle silently misreporting "0 facts on
 * people/alice" while legacy rows linger.
 *
 * The live-page requirement (#2484) is load-bearing: the inline facts
 * writer keeps producing `row_num IS NULL, entity_slug IS NOT NULL`
 * rows AFTER the migration completes, whenever a resolved slug has no
 * fenceable page (slugify-floor / stub-guard-blocked unprefixed slugs).
 * Those are structurally unfenceable — no page to fence onto, and the
 * ledger-complete migration won't re-run — so they must NOT gate, or
 * the phase jams forever (~16/day observed). Requiring a backing page
 * keeps genuine pre-v0.32.2 rows (whose entity page exists) gating
 * while excluding the inline-writer's permanent-unfenceable rows.
 *
 * Soft-expired rows don't count either (#2646): they're what
 * `forget_fact` produces, so excluding them lets operators drain the
 * backlog through the sanctioned removal path instead of raw SQL.

 *
 * Also excludes soft-expired legacy rows (#2646: `row_num IS NULL AND

 *
 * Deliberate consequence: if the fence still carries the same

 * as a fresh ACTIVE fence-owned row. That is the fence-is-canonical
 * contract working as documented — legacy DB-only forgets "DO NOT

 * would instead create silent fence↔DB divergence, the exact failure
 * mode the empty-fence guard exists to prevent. To durably forget
