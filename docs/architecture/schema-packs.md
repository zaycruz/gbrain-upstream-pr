# Schema Packs

A schema pack tells gbrain what shape your brain takes — which directories
exist, what types live in them, how the agent should infer types from
paths, and which link verbs connect what to what. The schema pack is the
**dynamic, always-consulted artifact** every skill reads when filing,
querying, or routing experts. It is the single source of truth for
"what's in your brain."

The v0.39.0.0 wave shipped a full schema-pack cathedral. This doc is the
user-facing reference; for implementation details see
`docs/designs/V038_SCHEMA_PACKS.md` (CEO plan) and the engine layer in
`src/core/schema-pack/`.

## What ships in the box

Bundled packs include:

- **`gbrain-base`** (default) — reproduces pre-v0.38 hardcoded behavior
  byte-for-byte. Existing brains see zero behavior change after upgrade.
  Covers: person, company, deal, meeting, project, place, concept, writing,
  analysis, guide, hardware, architecture, etc. (the original
  `ALL_PAGE_TYPES` list).

- **`gbrain-recommended`** — extends `gbrain-base` with the 13 additional
  directories described in `docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md`: deal,
  meeting, concept, project, source, daily, personal, civic, original,
  place, trip, conversation, writing. If you like the documented
  operational-brain pattern, activate this with:

  ```bash
  gbrain schema use gbrain-recommended
  ```

- **`raava-base`** — a self-contained superset of `gbrain-base` for
  Raava brains. It copies all 25 base page types plus the base link,
  frontmatter, enrichable, and filing declarations, then adds Raava's
  decision, lesson, thesis, journal, research, runbook, memory, ADR,
  knowledge-base, and ops-note types. It intentionally declares no
  migration mapping rules. Activate it with:

  ```bash
  gbrain schema use raava-base
  ```

Plus user-installed packs at `~/.gbrain/schema-packs/<name>/pack.yaml`
that you author with `gbrain schema init` or `gbrain schema fork`.

## CLI surface

Five inspection verbs (shipped in v0.38):

```bash
gbrain schema active     # show resolved pack + which tier set it
gbrain schema list       # list bundled + installed packs
gbrain schema show       # pretty-print the active pack
gbrain schema validate   # validate a manifest's shape
gbrain schema use <pack> # activate a pack (writes ~/.gbrain/config.json)
```

Eight authoring + discovery verbs (shipped in v0.39):

```bash
gbrain schema detect              # propose types matching brain shape
gbrain schema suggest             # LLM-refined proposals on top of detect
gbrain schema review-candidates   # promote / rename / ignore candidates
gbrain schema review-orphans      # surface pages with no matching type
gbrain schema init <name>         # scaffold a stub pack    (experimental)
gbrain schema fork <a> <b>        # copy + rename a pack    (experimental)
gbrain schema edit <name>         # surface the pack path   (experimental)
gbrain schema diff <a> <b>        # set-diff two packs      (experimental)
gbrain schema graph               # ASCII type listing      (experimental)
gbrain schema lint                # flag duplicates + missing prefixes
gbrain schema explain <type>      # plain-English type description (experimental)
gbrain schema downgrade --to <p>  # restore previous pack (recovery)
gbrain schema usage --since 30d   # per-verb invocation counts (D14 telemetry)
```

The verbs marked `experimental` are demand-gated per D14: their usage is
tracked via T15's schema-events audit, and v0.40+ retro decides whether
to deprecate any that stay <5% usage.

## Resolution chain (7 tiers)

When the engine decides "which pack is active for this query?", it walks
this chain top-down. First match wins.

| Tier | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Per-call `schema_pack` opt | CLI only (`ctx.remote === false`); MCP rejected. |
| 2 | `GBRAIN_SCHEMA_PACK` env | Process-scope override. |
| 3 | Per-source DB config key `schema_pack:source:<id>` | New in v0.38. |
| 4 | Brain-wide DB config key `schema_pack` | |
| 5 | `gbrain.yml schema:` section | Repo-checked. |
| 6 | `~/.gbrain/config.json` `schema_pack` field | What `gbrain schema use` writes. |
| 7 | Default: `gbrain-base` | Always present. |

## How the agent uses the active pack

Every read + write path consults the active pack at runtime:

- **`parseMarkdown`** infers page `type` from path prefixes declared in
  the active pack (`page_types[].path_prefixes`). Without an active pack
  threaded, falls back to the legacy hardcoded `inferType()` so the
  byte-for-byte parity gate stays green.
- **`whoknows` / `find_experts`** scopes candidates to `expert_routing:
  true` types in the active pack.
- **`extract_facts`** runs only on `extractable: true` types.
- **`enrichment-service`** routes person/company enrichment based on the
  pack's primitive declarations.
- **Search hybrid cache** (`knobsHash`) folds in pack name + version
  (v0.39 T21). A cache row written under pack A is unreachable when pack
  B is active. Cross-pack contamination is structurally impossible.

## The magical moment (T2-T4 + T10)

Persona A (Notion refugee) installs gbrain, imports her exports, and the
brain looks unfamiliar — the default `gbrain-base` pack expects
`people/`, `companies/`, etc., but her files live under `Projects/`,
`Reading/`, `Daily Notes/`. The friction signal fires in two places:

1. **Import warn (T7):** the end of `gbrain import` prints
   `[schema] X of Y pages (Z%) have no type matching the active schema
   pack. Run gbrain schema detect to propose a pack matching your
   content shape.`
2. **`gbrain doctor` schema_pack_consistency check** keeps surfacing
   the warning persistently after the import session ends.

She runs the magical moment:

```bash
gbrain schema detect              # heuristic clustering on her actual shape
gbrain schema suggest             # LLM-refined proposals
gbrain schema review-candidates   # human gate on promotion
gbrain schema review-candidates --apply Projects/   # accept
```

The agent (via the new EIIRP skill) automates phases 1-3 of this for any
significant work session. The brain's schema becomes a living artifact
the agent maintains, not a hardcoded ceremony the user authors.

## Authoring your own pack

```bash
gbrain schema init my-pack            # scaffolds ~/.gbrain/schema-packs/my-pack/pack.yaml
$EDITOR ~/.gbrain/schema-packs/my-pack/pack.yaml
gbrain schema validate my-pack        # check shape
gbrain schema use my-pack             # activate
gbrain schema active                  # confirm
```

A minimal pack:

```yaml
api_version: gbrain-schema-pack-v1
name: my-pack
version: 0.0.1
gbrain_min_version: 0.39.0
extends: gbrain-base   # inherits everything from base; add overrides below
description: |
  My personal pack.

page_types:
  - name: project-x
    primitive: entity
    path_prefixes:
      - Projects/
    aliases: []
    extractable: false
    expert_routing: false

  # Add more types here. Each maps a path prefix to a primitive +
  # opt-in flags. See src/core/schema-pack/base/gbrain-recommended.yaml
  # for a worked example.

link_types: []
takes_kinds: [fact, take, bet, hunch]
borrow_from: []
frontmatter_links: []
enrichable_types: []
filing_rules: []
```

## Recovery + revert

The single-PR cathedral is hard to revert atomically. Per codex finding
#4 from plan-eng-review, T20 ships `gbrain schema downgrade` to restore
the active-pack config field:

```bash
gbrain schema downgrade --to gbrain-base
# OR auto-detect previous from ~/.gbrain/schema-pack-history.jsonl:
gbrain schema downgrade
```

**Code revert alone is NOT sufficient.** The full revert procedure:

1. `git revert <merge-commit>` — restores the code.
2. `gbrain schema downgrade --to gbrain-base` — restores config.
3. (Optional) `gbrain pages purge-deleted --older-than 0h` — drops
   v0.39-typed pages that no longer have a matching type in the active
   pack.

The cache + eval rows that pack-aware code wrote are isolated by the
`knobsHash` pack-folding (T21) — they become unreachable under the
restored pack so no eviction is needed.

## Distribution

`.gbrain-schema` tarballs ride the same v0.37 skillpack pipeline as
`.gbrain-skillpack` tarballs (T14 artifact abstraction). The
discriminator is `api_version` in the manifest:

- `gbrain-schema-pack-v1` → schemapack
- `gbrain-skillpack-v1` → skillpack

Both install via the same scaffold + copy path; install targets are
`~/.gbrain/schema-packs/<name>/` and `~/.gbrain/skillpacks/<name>/`
respectively.

Publication to the public registries (`garrytan/gbrain-schema-registry`,
`garrytan/gbrain-skillpack-registry`) follows the same publish-as-PR
workflow as v0.37 skillpack publishing.

## What's deferred to v0.40+

- **Per-source pack federation across mounts.** A query crossing multiple
  sources currently rejects with `permission_denied` when those sources
  have divergent active packs (T19 + codex finding #2). The v0.40+ work
  computes a true per-source closure via the existing
  `buildSourceClosureCte` engine surface.
- **`extends` chain semver compatibility checks** between pack versions.
- **`skillpack ↔ schemapack` cross-reference declarations** — a skillpack
  can declare "I work best with these primitives present in your pack."
- **Live schema migration helpers** — when you add a type, auto-suggest
  backfill of existing pages.
- **Authoring vs derivation thesis reframe (D14).** v0.39.0.0 ships the
  full 11-verb cathedral with 6 verbs marked experimental-tier. v0.40+
  retro reads T23 usage telemetry to decide which to deprecate.

See `TODOS.md` v0.40+ section for the full deferred list.
