# Push-based context (#2095, v0.42.43.0)

Retrieval used to be pull-only: the agent had to *know to ask* before the brain
contributed anything. Push-based context inverts that — the brain volunteers
relevant pages from the recent conversation, confidence-gated so push noise
never becomes worse than pull silence.

Three channels share one zero-LLM core (`src/core/context/volunteer.ts`):

| Channel | Surface | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `reflex` | automatic, inside the context engine | default-on for plugin hosts; nothing to call |
| `op` | `gbrain volunteer-context` / MCP `volunteer_context` | agents without the plugin; one call per turn |
| `watch` | `gbrain watch` | stream a transcript in, volunteered pages stream out |

For Codex/OMX hosts, the `ambient-memory-hooks` integration recipe can invoke
the `op` channel automatically from `UserPromptSubmit` and return pointers in
private `additionalContext`. This removes the need for an always-search policy
skill while preserving the same confidence gate and pointer cap:

```bash
gbrain integrations install ambient-memory-hooks --target /path/to/host-repo
```

The recipe also supports conservative session capture. Capture is independently
switchable and requires an explicit durable-memory signal; routine conversation,
hidden context, private reasoning, and raw tool payloads are not captured. See
`recipes/ambient-memory-hooks.md` for host hook wiring and controls.

## How it decides

1. **Extract** entities across the last N turns (capitalized runs, `@handles`),
   merged with recency / frequency / user-role salience. Assistant-introduced
   entities and "what did she invest in?" follow-ups whose antecedent was named
   in the window now resolve.
2. **Resolve** through the alias table, exact titles, and slug suffixes — each
   arm carries an honest confidence: alias 0.9, exact title 0.8, slug-suffix 0.6,
   +0.05 when mentioned in ≥2 turns or the newest turn.
3. **Gate** at `min_confidence` (default 0.7 — slug-suffix matches need an
   explicit lower gate), suppress pages already surfaced (slug-presence only),
   cap at 3 pages (hard cap 5).

## CLI

```bash
# one-shot: pipe recent turns (oldest → newest)
printf 'user: ask alice-example about the deal\nassistant: noted\nuser: what did she say?\n' \
  | gbrain volunteer-context

# streaming: volunteered pages print as the transcript flows
some-transcript-feed | gbrain watch --json

# the feedback loop: how often were volunteered pages actually opened?
gbrain volunteer-context --stats
```

Stats are **approximate** by design: "used" means `pages.last_retrieved_at >
volunteered_at` — the 5-minute last-retrieved throttle causes false negatives
and unrelated reads of the same page cause false positives. Use the per-arm
precision to tune `min_confidence`, not as an exact metric.

**PGLite + `gbrain watch`:** PGLite is single-connection, and watch holds its
connection for the whole session — a concurrent `gbrain serve` or any write
path blocks until watch exits. On a PGLite brain, run watch in bursts (piped
input exits at EOF) or use the ambient reflex channel instead, which routes
through a running serve's resolve socket rather than taking the lock. Routing
watch through that same socket is a filed follow-up (TODOS.md). Postgres
brains are unaffected.

## Config

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `retrieval_reflex_window_turns` | 4 | turns the ambient reflex extracts from; 1 = legacy current-turn-only (file/env plane: `GBRAIN_RETRIEVAL_REFLEX_WINDOW_TURNS`) |
| `retrieval_reflex` | true | the ambient channel's master switch |
| `retrieval_reflex_max_pointers` | 3 | pointer cap per turn |

Per-call knobs: `max_pages` + `min_confidence` on both the op and `gbrain watch`
(`--max-pages` / `--min-confidence`, plus `--window-turns` / `--source` on watch);
on the op only: `prior_context` (text whose already-surfaced slugs are suppressed),
`session_id` / `turn` attribution params (watch stamps its own per-session id and
turn numbers in the feedback log), and `days` to size the `--stats` window.

## Storage + privacy

Volunteered pages log to `context_volunteer_events` (migration v117): slug,
arm, confidence, channel, optional session/turn — the rationale is a
deterministic template string, never raw conversation text. Event writes are
best-effort (fire-and-forget, drained at CLI exit) — the log is a tuning signal,
not an audit trail. Rows are pruned after 90 days by the dream cycle's purge
phase. Synopses always strip the takes/facts fences — the same strip `get_page`
applies to untrusted callers, applied unconditionally here so private fence rows
never reach a prompt regardless of caller trust.
