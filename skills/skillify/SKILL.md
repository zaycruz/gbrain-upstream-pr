# Skillify — The Meta Skill

> **Relationship to `/cross-modal-review`:** That skill is the manual mid-flow
> "second opinion" gate (one model reviews work product before commit). This
> skill's Phase 3 below uses `gbrain eval cross-modal` instead — three
> different-provider frontier models score-and-iterate on a documented
> dimension list *before* tests cement behavior. Use `/cross-modal-review`
> for ad-hoc second opinions; use Phase 3 here when skillifying a feature.

## Contract

A feature is "properly skilled" when all 11 checklist items pass. Item 3
(cross-modal eval) is informational in v1.1.0 — it does not gate the
skillpack-check audit, but a missing or stale receipt is surfaced so the
user knows where the gate stands.

## The Checklist

```
□ 1.  SKILL.md           — skill file with frontmatter + contract + phases
□ 2.  Code               — deterministic script if applicable
□ 3.  Cross-modal eval   — 3 frontier models from 3 providers; informational
□ 4.  Unit tests         — cover every branch of deterministic logic
□ 5.  Integration tests  — exercise live endpoints
□ 6.  LLM evals          — quality/correctness cases for LLM-involving steps
□ 7.  Resolver trigger   — entry in skills/RESOLVER.md with real user trigger phrases
□ 8.  Resolver eval      — test that triggers route to this skill
□ 9.  Check-resolvable   — DRY + MECE audit, no orphans
□ 10. E2E test           — smoke test: trigger → side effect
□ 11. Brain filing       — if it writes pages, entry in brain/RESOLVER.md
```

## Phase 0: Should This Be a Skill?

Before skillifying, check:
- Will this be invoked 2+ times? (One-off work ≠ skill)
- Is there >20 lines of logic? (Trivial helpers don't need full infrastructure)
- Does it have a clear trigger phrase a user would actually say?

If ANY answer is no, it's a script, not a skill — stop here. Do not scaffold, write a SKILL.md, run evals, or write tests for it. Tell the user why and move on.

Scope check (upper bound): one skill = one capability = one coherent trigger
family. If the target spans multiple distinct intents users would invoke
separately ("run the build" / "roll back the deploy" / "notify the team" are
three intents, not one), do NOT build one skill covering them all. Stop,
propose splitting into separate skillify targets, and ask the user which one
to skillify first.

## Phase 1: Audit

```
Feature: [name]
Code: [path]
Missing items: [check each of the 11]
```

## Phase 2: Write SKILL.md + Code (items 1-2)

### SKILL.md frontmatter template (copy-paste):

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  One paragraph. What it does, when to use it.
triggers:
  - "trigger phrase users actually say"
  - "another real trigger"
tools:
  - exec
  - read
  - write
mutating: false  # true if it writes to brain/disk
---
```

Body must include: **Contract** (what it guarantees), **Phases** (step-by-step), **Output Format** (what it produces).

Extract deterministic code into `scripts/*.ts`.

## Phase 3: Cross-Modal Eval (item 3) — THE QUALITY GATE

### Why this comes before tests

Tests lock in behavior. If the behavior is mediocre, tests lock in mediocrity.
Cross-modal eval proves the quality bar FIRST, then tests cement it.

### Step 1: Pick a representative input

Choose the input that exercises the skill's hardest documented use case. If
unsure: use the primary trigger example from SKILL.md, or the most complex
real-world input from the last 7 days of memory files.

### Step 2: Run the skill, capture output

Run the skill on the representative input. The OUTPUT FILE is what gets
evaluated.

### Step 3: Run the eval gate

```bash
gbrain eval cross-modal \
  --task "What this skill is supposed to accomplish" \
  --output skills/<slug>/SKILL.md
```

The command runs 3 frontier models from 3 different providers in parallel,
scores the OUTPUT against the TASK on 5 documented dimensions, and writes a
receipt under `~/.gbrain/.gbrain/eval-receipts/<slug>-<sha8>.json` (the
sha-8 binds the receipt to the current SKILL.md content — re-running after
edits writes a new receipt).

**Default models** (override per slot via `--slot-a-model`, `--slot-b-model`,
`--slot-c-model`):

| Slot | Default | Provider |
|------|---------|----------|
| A | `openai:gpt-5.2` | OpenAI |
| B | `anthropic:claude-opus-4-7` | Anthropic |
| C | `deepseek:deepseek-v4-pro` | DeepSeek |

**These MUST be frontier models from DIFFERENT providers.** Using a single
provider's family or budget models defeats the purpose — different families
have less correlated blind spots. Refresh the list when a new model
generation ships.

**Pass criteria (BOTH must be true):**

1. Every dimension's mean across successful models ≥ 7.
2. No single model scored any dimension < 5 (the floor).

**Inconclusive:** fewer than 2 of 3 models returned parseable scores.
Receipt is still written (forensics) but the gate is not authoritative.
Exit code 2; CI wrappers should treat this as "did not run cleanly", not
"failed quality gate".

### Step 4: Cycle until you pass (≤3 cycles)

```
CYCLE 1:
  Eval → scores + top 10 improvements
  IF pass: → done, write tests
  ELSE:
    Apply top 10 improvements to the actual file
    Log: which improvements applied, what changed

CYCLE 2:
  Re-eval the FIXED output (same 3 models, same dimensions)
  Compare: before/after scores per dimension (track delta)
  IF pass: → done, write tests
  ELSE: apply remaining improvements + new ones

CYCLE 3 (final):
  Re-eval
  IF pass: → ship
  ELSE: → ship with KNOWN_GAPS section listing:
    - Which dimensions are still below 7
    - Which improvements couldn't be resolved
    - Why (e.g., "would require architectural change")
```

### Cycles + cost guardrails

- Default `--cycles 3` in TTY, `--cycles 1` in non-TTY (limits scripted
  bulk spend in CI loops).
- The command prints an estimated max-cost-per-cycle from a small pricing
  constant before each run. Real cost varies with prompt size; treat the
  estimate as a ceiling for default `--max-tokens 4000`.
- A `--budget-usd N` hard cap is a v0.27.x follow-up TODO.

### Provider configuration

Models resolve through the gbrain AI gateway. Configure once with:

```bash
gbrain providers test    # see what's configured
gbrain config            # set keys
```

Or set env vars: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, etc. The gateway reads
from `~/.gbrain/config.json` plus `process.env`.

### Cost expectations

3 cycles × 3 models = 9 frontier calls max per run. With Opus-class +
GPT-4o-class + Gemini-1.5-Pro, expect $1–3 per full run on default
`--max-tokens 4000`. Receipts include the per-call model identifiers so
you can audit retroactively.

### Skip cross-modal eval when:

- Output is < 200 tokens (trivial — not worth 9 API calls).
- The skill is a thin wrapper around a single API call (one cycle is enough).

## Phase 4: Tests (items 4-6)

NOW that eval has proven quality, write tests that lock it in:

**Unit tests** — every branch of deterministic logic. Mock external calls.
**Integration tests** — hit real endpoints. Catch bugs mocks hide.
**LLM evals** — quality/correctness for LLM steps. Lighter than cross-modal eval — test specific behaviors.

## Phase 5: Resolver + Check-Resolvable (items 7-9)

1. Add to skills/RESOLVER.md with trigger phrases users ACTUALLY type
2. Resolver eval: feed triggers, assert correct routing
3. Check-resolvable:
   - Skill reachable from skills/RESOLVER.md (not orphaned)
   - No MECE overlap with other skills
   - No DRY violations (shared logic in lib/, not copy-pasted)
   - No ambiguous trigger routing

## Phase 6: E2E + Brain Filing (items 10-11)

- E2E smoke: full pipeline from trigger to side effect
- Brain filing: add to brain/RESOLVER.md if the skill writes brain pages

## Phase 7: Verify

```bash
bun test test/<skill>.test.ts                    # unit tests
gbrain skillify check skills/<slug>/scripts/<slug>.mjs --json | \
  jq '.[] | .items[] | select(.name | contains("Cross-modal"))'
ls ~/.gbrain/.gbrain/eval-receipts/              # receipt landed
gbrain check-resolvable --json | jq .ok          # resolver clean
```

## Worked Example: Skillifying a "summarize-pr" Feature

```
Phase 0: Yes — invoked weekly, 50+ lines, clear trigger "summarize this PR"
Phase 1: Audit → SKILL.md missing, no tests, no resolver entry. Score: 1/11
Phase 2: Write SKILL.md + extract script to scripts/summarize-pr.ts
Phase 3: Cross-modal eval cycle 1 →
  GPT-4o: goal=6, depth=5, specificity=4 → "misses file-level diffs"
  Opus 4.7: goal=7, depth=6, specificity=5 → "no test plan in summary"
  Gemini 1.5 Pro: goal=6, depth=5, specificity=5 → "template feels generic"
  Aggregate: goal=6.3 FAIL, depth=5.3 FAIL
  Top improvements: add file-level changes, include test plan, use PR context
  → Apply fixes → Cycle 2: goal=8, depth=7.5, specificity=7 → PASS
Phase 4: Write 12 unit tests locking in the improved behavior
Phase 5: Add "summarize this PR" trigger to skills/RESOLVER.md
Phase 6: E2E test: feed a real PR URL → verify brain page created
Phase 7: All green. Score: 11/11
```

## Quality Gates

NOT properly skilled until:

- All required items pass (1-2, 4-10; 11 only when applicable).
- Cross-modal eval (item 3) has a current receipt OR is explicitly waived
  with rationale (item 3 is informational; not blocking, but a missing
  receipt is visible in the audit).
- All tests pass (unit + integration + LLM evals).
- Resolver entry exists with real trigger phrases.
- Check-resolvable shows no orphans, overlaps, or DRY violations.
- Brain filing if applicable.

## Output Format

Skillify produces three durable artifacts per skill:

1. **The skill tree on disk.** `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`, `scripts/<slug>.mjs`,
   `routing-eval.jsonl`, plus a `test/<slug>.test.ts` skeleton. Generated by
   `gbrain skillify scaffold <name>` and refined by the human/agent into a
   real implementation.
2. **A cross-modal eval receipt** at
   `~/.gbrain/.gbrain/eval-receipts/<slug>-<sha8>.json`. The sha-8 binds the
   receipt to the current `SKILL.md` content. `gbrain skillify check`
   surfaces the status (`found` / `stale` / `missing`) as informational.
3. **An audit verdict** from `gbrain skillify check`: `properly skilled` |
   `close — create: <missing items>` | `needs skillify — run /skillify on
   <target>`. Score is `<passed>/<total>`. Required items gate the verdict;
   item 11 (cross-modal eval) is informational and never blocks PASS.

JSON output (`gbrain skillify check --json`) includes the same fields plus
the per-item detail string, so agents can route on the structured envelope
without parsing prose.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Writing tests before cross-modal eval (locks in mediocrity)
- ❌ Using budget models for eval (C student grading A student)
- ❌ Using a single provider's family for all 3 slots (correlated blind spots)
- ❌ Skipping eval "because the output looks fine" (your judgment isn't 3 models)
- ❌ Eval without fix cycle (vanity metrics)
- ❌ Code with no SKILL.md (invisible to resolver)
- ❌ Tests that reimplement production code (masks real bugs)
- ❌ Resolver entry with internal jargon (must mirror real user language)
- ❌ Two skills doing the same thing (merge or kill one)
- ❌ Running cross-modal eval on trivial outputs (< 200 tokens, not worth 9 API calls)
